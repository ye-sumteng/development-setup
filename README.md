# Development Setup
**Prepare development environment**
- **Boot Partition**: The location where we will put Ubuntu GRUB.
- **Swap Partition**: The partition used to swap files , its function is to add memory if the RAM is full. 
- **Root Partition**: The location where we will install Ubuntu.
- **Home Partition** (Optional): Home is the location where we will store personal files (documents, music, pictures, etc.). Because it is optional, we can add it or make it one with the Root partition.
